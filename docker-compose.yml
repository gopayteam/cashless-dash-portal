# This Docker Compose file is set up for the Angular frontend application.
# A production application typically consists of at least a frontend and a backend,
# with the backend connecting to a database.

# To add a backend and a database to this setup, you would:
# 1. Create a Dockerfile for your backend application.
# 2. Add a service for your backend in this file, similar to the 'frontend' service.
# 3. Add a service for your database (e.g., postgres, mysql, mongodb).
# 4. Configure the backend service to connect to the database service.
# 5. Configure the frontend to communicate with the backend service.
